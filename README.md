The Global Abundance Project aims to facilitate microfinance loans in developing countries using a simple platform with funds distributed in ERC20 tokens and with each borrower's loan and repayment history stored in a smart contract.
As soon as is practicable, we will use the [Qi Currency](http://fintechworldwide.blogspot.com/2018/06/blockchain-capital-women-and.html) as the token in which funds are transferred.

### Stack:
We will use a Node.js & PostgreSQL backend,
The Ropsten testnet for running smart contracts in Solidity
